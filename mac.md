## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?  Git is used a lot in jobs to track changes in the source code with lots of people being able to work together on a non-linear development.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?  Git is a source system to manage and track your code history , while github is a cloud based system that you can track and organize your repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch? We create a branch to work on a code by copying it to test it out first and make any changes before adding it to the main project.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? The purpsoe of a pull request is to inform other people that you have modified and pushed new changes to a branch in a repository.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. The command you use between branches is cd .. and then you would use cd plus the name of the folder you are looking for.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch get/pulls the new changes while Git pull gets the downloads from the repository and updates it to match the content and then Git merge gets the forked history together again.

7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when people do an action at the same time. An example would be  if mutilple people deleted a file at the same time.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? To resolve a merge conflict you have to open the file and modify the new changes and after that you can use the git add a command to merge the new changes. The last thing would be to create a new commit.
